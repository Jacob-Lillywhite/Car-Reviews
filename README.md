> The Admin should be able to update a Car's Condition so they know the most recent condition of a car when they send it out. The Admin should be able to see all the invoices and different 'collections' of cars. The User will only see the collection of vehicles they have rented and the invoices the have/had. Anyone can see reviews posted. (The admin should probably have access to delete a review if they're innappropriate/violate ToS). For image uploading, Reviews seem like the natural choice to have an image paried with.
